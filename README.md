## Introduction

The Unity Input Manager package provides a collection of [Zinnia] Actions that wrap [Unity] inputs from the legacy [Unity Input Manager]. These Actions can be used to map keyboard/button presses or axis data via the Unity Input Manager.

A collection of useful prefabs are also provided with pre-defined button and axis mappings for common controller types:

* Xbox Gamepad
* OpenVR controller
* Oculus Remote
* Oculus Touch controller
* Windows Mixed Reality controller

This package will also prompt to create any required and missing Unity Input Manager axes.

The new [Unity Input System] is available in Unity `2019.1.0f1` and to use that instead then see the [Tilia.Input.UnityInputSystem] repository.

> **Requires** the Unity software version `2018.3.10f1` (or above).
